# Holiday Peak Lib

Core shared framework for retail agent services in this repository.

It provides:

- Agent foundations (`BaseRetailAgent`, `AgentBuilder`, MCP exposure)
- Adapter contracts and domain adapters
- Canonical schemas and truth-layer models
- Shared app factory and configuration settings
- Reliability/telemetry helpers (retry, circuit breaker, bulkhead, telemetry)
- Structured `/invoke` outcome telemetry for success/degraded/error traceability in Azure Monitor/Application Insights
- Autonomous self-healing runtime (incident lifecycle, remediation policy, audit trail)
- Connectors and integration contracts for enterprise systems

## Location

- Source package: `lib/src/holiday_peak_lib`
- Package metadata: `lib/src/pyproject.toml`
- Library tests: `lib/tests`

## Setup

From repository root:

```bash
uv sync --directory lib/src --extra dev --extra test --extra lint
```

If you already have a virtual environment active and prefer pip:

```bash
pip install -e lib/src[dev,test,lint]
```

## Quick Usage

```python
from holiday_peak_lib.app_factory import build_service_app

app = build_service_app(
    service_name="my-service",
    slm_config=slm_config,
    llm_config=llm_config,
)
```

## Self-Healing Runtime

Every service assembled through `build_service_app` inherits a shared self-healing kernel with:

- Incident lifecycle state machine: detect -> classify -> remediate -> verify -> escalate/closed
- Surface coverage: `api`, `apim`, `aks_ingress`, `mcp`, and `messaging`
- Recoverable classification policy for infrastructure misconfiguration (`4xx` and selected `5xx`)
- Allowlisted remediation actions with audit records
- Guardrail that forbids image restore/redeploy remediation actions

Feature flags:

- `SELF_HEALING_ENABLED` (`false` by default)
- `SELF_HEALING_DETECT_ONLY` (`false` by default)
- `SELF_HEALING_SURFACE_MANIFEST_JSON` (optional JSON contract override)
- `SELF_HEALING_RECONCILE_ON_MESSAGING_ERROR` (optional, default `false`)

Operational routes exposed on every service:

- `GET /self-healing/status`
- `GET /self-healing/incidents`
- `POST /self-healing/reconcile`

## Testing

From repository root:

```bash
python -m pytest lib/tests
```

Or from the `lib/src` package directory (uses local pytest config):

```bash
cd lib/src
python -m pytest
```

- This README intentionally reflects the current workspace structure and avoids static test-count snapshots.
